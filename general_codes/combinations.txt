no of ways of choosing r objects from n when repetition is allowed

	(n+r-1)C(r)

no of ways of choosing r objects from n when repetition is now allowed

	nCr

nCr = n!/ ((n-r)! * r!)

nCr = n * n-1 * n-2... n-r+1 / 1 * 2 * 3 * 4..r

nCr = (n-1)C(r-1) + (n-1)cr //useful for building tables using DP

nCr = nC(n-r)

no of permutations of n objets: n!

no of circular permutations of n objects : (n-1)!

no of permutations of r objecs taken from n objects
nPr = n!/ (n-r)!

nPn = n!
